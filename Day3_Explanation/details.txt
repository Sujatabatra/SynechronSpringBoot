What Spring Security can do?
1. Username/password authentication
2. SSO/Okta/Ldap
3. App Level Authorization
4. Intra App Authorization like OAuth
5. Microservice Security ( with tokens like JWT)

5 Core Concepts in Spring Security
1. Authentication : Who you are with ID
// username & password
knowledge base authentication
passwords
pincode
Answer to secret or personal ques

Possession base authentication
- phone/text message
-key cards
-access token

Knowledge base + Possesion based authentication
Multi Factor Authentication


2. Authorization : Can this user do this? ( yes/no) 


3. Principal : Currently Logged in user.
If you are Authenticated to an application , you will be stored as a principal


4. Granted Authority : Fine grained permission

5. Roles : Group of authorities ( coarse grained permission)



// Spring security Depedency  ( Basic Auth)
1. Add login form
2. Created a user & sets a default password
3. logout page
4. handle login error




How to configure Spring Security Authentication

1. add Dependency

AuthenticationManager ==> AuthenticationManagerBuilder


How we can configure Authorization
Different Api having different access requirement

API : /
Allow Access it to All

API : /user
Allow Access it to USER and ADMIN Role

API : /admin
Allow Access it to ADMIN Role

HttpSecurity : what are the paths and access restrictions to those paths.
